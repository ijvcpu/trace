R.A. Trace, Hyperdimensional Detective in: The Case of the Purloined Polygon
Version 0.3, 10/24/2023

This program, written primarily in JavaScript, is a brief "vertical slice" showcase of an engine designed to run point-and-click style video games.
This engine - nicknamed the "Cyan3 Engine" because everything needs a catchy name - allows for switching between three different game modes:

Map Mode: Allows the player to move and interact within in a grid-based point-and-click level
Dialogue Mode: Allows the player to view visual-novel style conversations and choose from branching choices
Phone Mode: Displays a virtual cellular phone which serves both as the game menu and an additional interactive storytelling medium, complete with apps for text messaging and social media

These three game modes are designed to allow games developed in the Cyan3 Engine to present players with a number of different avenues to interact with a given game world and its features.

The 3D graphics for the game were created using Bryce3D, a 3D modeling program capable of ray tracing that was originally released in 1994.

Please see the comments included with the program's code for more specific details about the program's functionality.

This Version 0.3 vertical slice demo of "R.A. Trace" is fully playable, but is missing a few features planned for the full release.

Planned Features:
-Virtual social media apps in phone mode
-An on-screen inventory system for managing items in map mode
